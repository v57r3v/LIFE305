(i.e. 5% penalty for every 10% above word count)·   Enter your word count at the bottom of your submission2. Submission ·   Your work should be submitted via the submission link in your module area in Canvas·   Please make sure that you follow the guidance on written assessments which can be found on the School Canvas Page.·   Also refer to the School Canvas pages in relation to the penalties for Late Submission and possible exemptions.·   If you have any technical problems submitting to Canvas by the deadline, you must email your work to the module organiser (copying in [email   protected] ) by the deadline, as evidence that you have submitted in time.

The University’s Academic Integrity policy and your annual Academic Integrity declaration 
apply to this assessment. If necessary, the full range of penalties (Category A, B, C, D, and E)
will be available to examiners if they discover contraventions of the Academic Integrity
policy. You can consult the University’s Academic Integrity guide for students here:https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/tqsd/code-of-practice-on-assessment/appendix_L_cop_assess_annex1.pdf Please note: Your answer should be written in your own words. Do not use any verbatim (word for word) quotes. Your assignment may not contain verbatim (copy-and-paste) material that you have submitted for another assessment, either on this or a different module.4. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) instructions.
The University permits you to use GenAI tools to assist in the preparation of your assignments provided that doing so is consistent with the University’s guidance on acceptable and unacceptable uses of GenAI.

To promote honest and ethical use of GenAI, the School of Biosciences requires students to declare whether they have used GenAI tools in the preparation of each coursework assessment that they submit. If you have used GenAI tool(s), you must explain what tools you used and how you used them. Failure to include a declaration and/or provide clear and satisfactory information on how you used them, where relevant, will lead to a marks deductions (see below).
For each assignment you must include and complete the following table before your answer; the declaration is not included in a word count.·   In the general statement, delete ‘did’ or ‘did not’ as applicable·   If you declare that you did use GenAI, you must then provide the following代 写LIFE305 Cell Signalling in Health and Disease 2024/25Haskell

Penalties for not declaring GenAI tools and/or inadequate description when used.·   There are no penalties if you declare that you did or did not use GenAI and, if you did, provide a clear and satisfactory description of what you used them for.·   A 2% deduction will be imposed if you do include the declaration that you used GenAI but did not provide sufficient information of what tools you used, and how.·   A 5% deduction will be imposed if you do not include the declaration at all; i.e., when you do not state whether you did or did not use GenAI tools.·   If you declare that you did not use GenAI tools, but it is later proven that you did, the Academic Integrity Committee will investigate academic misconduct for a false declaration.
Expectations: 
In this assessment, we expect students to write well-structured answers to each question which correctly use the appropriate terminology and referencing. To provide context, you should give background information based on the relevant module content. When you address the question, you should use your knowledge and understanding of the module content, but you should also use relevant literature to add a different perspective and/or more detail. To address the data analysis aspects of questions, you should demonstrate your ability to interpret and critique the data presented and to draw relevant conclusions. At the higher end of the marking scheme, markers will also be looking for elements of criticality and synthesis.
Specific instructions: 
Please answer ALL questions.
Coursework Question(s): 
This assessment is based on the following research paper (PDF available on Canvas):
BAP1 is a novel regulator of HIF-1α 
Bononi et al 
Proc Natl Acad Sci 2023 Jan 24;120(4):e2217840120. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2217840120.
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217840120 
Please answer the three following questions:1. Pick the figure* in the paper that you think is the most important for the overall conclusions. Briefly describe the results, the experimental approach(es) used and why you think that it is the key figure in the paper.  * Selected figure needs to include all sub-panels (e.g. Fig 1A-I or Fig 2A-E, not Fig 1F or 2D) Indicative length: Approx. 300 words 2. Draw an original diagram and briefly discuss the signalling pathway delineated in this study and highlight how this adds to what was previously known about HIF regulation. Focus on the crosstalk between post-translational modifications and protein:protein interactions, and include all of the regulators of the pathway.  Indicative length: Figure plus approx. 400 words 3. From what you know about aberrant HIF activity in cancer, describe how these novel findings contribute to our understanding of the role of BAP1 in human malignancies?  Indicative length: Approx. 300 words
